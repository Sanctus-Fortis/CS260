# Notes For Website Creation
And thus I said unto myself; "This is the place. I shall keep all the knowledge of html, css and javascript here upon mine Github. And nations will flock unto it and drink of the well of web programming."

## HTML
For the html files I started by plotting out the structure of the site. I had some issues with how I would fill the websocket requirement but I have narrowed it does to two options, either display a live feed of saved builds in the character builder application, or display a live feed of some kind of in game data. I want to preserve the privacy of players so displaying any identifiable Steam information would not be ideal. There should be a simple way around this and I am leaning towards this option.

### 404 Page
I started with the 404 page and created a simple message with a link back to index.html. 

### index.html
Contains a simple explanation of what the site is for as well as links. All other pages will have the same set of links so you can get anywhere from anywhere, though if you are not signed in then the builder page will redirect to login.

### informational pages
About and media kit pages are very barebones and similar right now, they'll diverge as they get filled out.
