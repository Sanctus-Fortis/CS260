    <p>Founded in January 2025 as a partnership between two brothers, Sanctus Studios seeks to provide the sort of gaming experiences that many players are not finding in the mainline gaming industry. Gamers and developers are often exploited for time and money. Our studio promises no paid DLC, no early access and no live service. We produce games, not services and hop that you can enjoy our work. Our games do not rely on external servers to play with your friends so even if we disappear our work can still be enjoyed by those who love it.</p>
    <p>Our first game, an old school dungeon crawler is currently in development with test demos expected before the end of the year.</p>
